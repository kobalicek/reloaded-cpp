# Reloaded C/C++

Extension that replaces the built-in C/C++ tokenizer/grammar and introduces additional tokens that can be styled. This extension should be used together with [Reloaded Themes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=reloadedextensions.reloaded-themes) extension as the additional tokens are new and not recognized by other themes!

# Important

  * This extension DOES NOT provide code assistance, it just recognizes common patterns used in today's C++ code.
  * This extension is experimental and should be used only with themes that understand the additional tokens it recognizes. If you don't use a compatible theme there is no point of using this extension.
  * Suggestions are welcome, if you think about more tokens / symbols to be recognized please fill an issue.

# Concepts provided

  * It treats C/C++ the same way (no more separate grammar for C, the reason was that header files were already tokenized as C++ anyway, so there was no point of maintaining two grammars).
  * It supports C and C++ keywords and provides styles so each keyword can be highlighted individually (you can highlight inline differently than extern, for example).
  * It recognizes formatting and escaping of C/C++ strings like `"%d"` and `"\n"`, respectively.
  * It recognizes basic markdown and doxy-style commands in C/C++ comments, both `\\` and `@` doxygen escapes are recognized.
  * It recognizes common types and constants of standard C library, Windows, Linux, and MAC.
  * It recognizes `assert()` and `YOUR_OWN_ASSERT()`-like macros.
  * It recognizes `likely()/unlikely()` and `YOUR_OWN_LIKELY()`-like macros.
  * It recognizes `IS_ERROR()`, `SUCCEEDED()`, and similar macros for error handling.
  * It recognizes specific patterns in type/variable names, like `FirstUppercased`, `ALL_UPPERCASED`, and `typename_t`, these can be specified in themes and styled differently.
  * It recognizes error constants like libc's `ESOMETHING`, `kErr...`, `kError...`, and `ERROR_...`.
  * It recognizes success constants like `noErr`, `ERROR_OK`, `kNoErr`, `kErrorOk`, etc...
  * Constants representing *success* and *failure* and can be highlighted differently.
  * Many other improvements you may find useful.
